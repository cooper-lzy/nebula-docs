# BALANCE syntax

We can submit tasks to load balance Storage services in NebulaGraph. For more information about storage load balancing and examples, see [Storage load balance](../8.service-tuning/load-balance.md).

The syntax for load balance is described as follows.

{{ comm.comm_begin }}

|Syntax|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`BALANCE LEADER`| Starts a job to balance the distribution of all the storage leaders in graph spaces. It returns the job ID. |

{{ comm.comm_end }}

{{ ent.ent_begin }}

|Syntax|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`BALANCE LEADER`| Starts a job to balance the distribution of all the storage leaders in graph spaces. It returns the job ID. |
|`BALANCE DATA`| Starts a job to balance the distribution of storage partitions in the current graph space. It returns the job ID. |
|`BALANCE DATA REMOVE <ip:port> [,<ip>:<port> ...]`| Migrate the partitions in the specified storage host to other storage hosts in the current graph space. |

!!! note

    `REMOVE` can only clear the partitions of the current graph space. If a Storage service has a large number of graph spaces, you need to switch to all different graph spaces to perform the `REMOVE` operation.

{{ ent.ent_end }}

For details about how to view, stop, and restart a job, see [Job manager and the JOB statements](../3.ngql-guide/4.job-statements.md).
