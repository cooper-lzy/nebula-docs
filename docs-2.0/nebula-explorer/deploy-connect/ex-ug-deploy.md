# Deploy Explorer

This topic describes how to deploy Explorer locally by RPM, DEB, and tar packages.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Explorer, you must check the following information:

- The [license key](../../9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/3.license-manager.md) is loaded.

- The NebulaGraph services are deployed and started. For more information, see [NebulaGraph Database Manual](../../2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow.md).

- Before the installation starts, the following ports are not occupied.

   | Port | Description |
   | ---- | ---- |
   | 7002 | Web service provided by Explorer |

  !!! caution

        By default, Explorer uses the port `7002`. You can modify the `httpport` in the `conf/app.conf` file in the installation directory and restart the service.

- The Linux distribution is CentOS.

## Precautions

The Dag Controller installation package is built in Explorer starting from version 3.2.0, which provides graph computing services. The user can decide whether or not to start the Dag Controller service. If the Dag Controller service is not started, the **Workflow** menu in Explorer will appear gray and cannot be clicked.

In addition, if you need to use **Workflow** for complex graph computing, you need to configure NFS or HDFS after installing Explorer. Namenode uses port 8020 by default, and datanode uses port 50010 by default. For details, see [Prepare resources](../../nebula-explorer/workflow/1.prepare-resources.md) of **Workflow**.

<!--  !!! caution

       If the HDFS port is unavailable, the connection timeout message may be displayed. -->

  # Start Explorer separately.
  sudo nohup ./nebula-explorer-server > explorer.log 2>&1 &
  ```

### Stop Service

You can use `kill pid` to stop the service.

```bash
kill $(lsof -t -i :7002)
```

## Configure Dag Controller

Dag Controller is a task scheduling tool that can schedule the jobs whose type is DAG (directed acyclic graph). The job consists of multiple tasks to form a directed acyclic graph, and there is a dependency between the tasks.

The Dag Controller can perform complex graph computing with NebulaGraph Analytics. For example, the Dag Controller sends an algorithm request to NebulaGraph Analytics, which saves the result to NebulaGraph or HDFS. The Dag Controller then takes the result as input to the next algorithmic task to create a new task.

### Steps

1. Complete the SSH password-free configurations so that the Dag Controller machine can log directly into the NebulaGraph Analytics machines and all machines within the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster can connect directly to each other without passwords.

  For example, the user in machine A (Dag Controller) logs directly into machine B-1 in the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster over SSH  without passwords. Run the following commands on machine A:

  ```
  //Press Enter to execute the default option to generate the key.
  ssh-keygen -t rsa

  //After the public key file of machine A is installed to the user of the machine B-1, you can log into the machine B-1 from the machine A without passwords.
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <B_user>@<B_IP>
  ```

  In the same way, complete the SSH password-free configurations so that the user in machine A can log directly into machines B-2, B-3, etc. and all machines within the NebulaGraph Analytics cluster can connect directly to each other without passwords.

2. Run `eval $(ssh-agent)` on the Dag Controller machine to start the ssh-agent, then run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to give the private key to the ssh-agent to manage.

  !!! note

        ssh-agent is a key manager that manages multiple keys and provides proxies for other programs that need to use SSH key pairs.

3. Configure the username and port of the NebulaGraph Analytics in the file `dag-ctrl-api.yaml`, the file path is `dag-ctrl/etc/dag-ctrl-api.yaml`. If there are multiple machines, ensure that the usernames and ports are the same.

  ```
  # configuration name.
  Name: task-api

  Host: 0.0.0.0     # The IP address of Dag Controller.
  Port: 9002        # The port of Dag Controller.
  Timeout: 60000    # he timeout duration of HTTP interface requests.

  Log:              # The parameters related to log printing. For more Information, see https://go-zero.dev/cn/docs/blog/tool/logx/

   Size: 10    # Up to 10 tasks can be executed in parallel.
  Dag:
   VarDataListMaxSize: 100    # If HDFS columns are read, the number is limited to 100 at a time.

  ```

4. Configure the algorithm file path (`exec_file`) only in the file `tasks.yaml`, the file path of which is `dag-ctrl/etc/tasks.yaml`. Currently, all `exec_file` parameters are set to the path of the `run_algo.sh` file.

  !!! note

      - The algorithm files are provided by NebulaGraph Analytics. Please find the `scripts` directory under the installation path of NebulaGraph Analytics above. All algorithm files are in this directory.  
      - If there are multiple machines, ensure that the algorithm file paths are the same.
      - The other parameters are the execution parameters of the algorithms and are configured later on the [visual workflow page](../workflow/2.create-workflow.md).

  ```bash
  exec_file: /home/xxx/nebula-analytics/scripts/run_algo.sh
  ```
