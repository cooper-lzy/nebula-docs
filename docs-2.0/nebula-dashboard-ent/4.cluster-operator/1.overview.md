# Cluster overview

This topic introduces the **Cluster Overview** page of Dashboard, which contains the following parts:

- **Info Overview**
- **Cluster Topology**
- **Monitoring Screen**

## Entry

1. At the top navigation bar of the Dashboard Enterprise Edition page, click **Cluster Management**.
2. Click **Detail** on the right of the cluster management page to check the overview of a specified cluster.

## Info Overview

### Cluster key information

In the cluster key information, the following information is displayed.

- Cluster health score: Displays the health of the cluster on a percentage basis. It is refreshed every 5 minutes, or immediately if there is an emergency level alarm. The calculation formula can be configured on the **Cluster Diagnosis** page.
- Monitoring nodes and services: Display the number of online nodes/total nodes and the number of online services/total services. Different types of services are displayed separately. Click on ![watch](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/watch.png) to access the [Service](./operator/service.md) page.
- Number of slow queries (5min): The number of slow queries in the cluster in the last 5 minutes.
- Newly created sessions (5min): The number of newly created sessions in the cluster in the last 5 minutes.
- Latest backup time: The latest backup time of the cluster. Click on ![watch](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/watch.png) to access the [Backup and Restore](./operator/backup-and-restore.md) page.
- Total storage usage: The total storage usage of the cluster. Click on ![watch](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/watch.png) to display more details.

### Cluster monitoring panel

In the cluster monitoring panel, users can select and view monitoring data from different periods. Users can either select a custom time range or choose from predefined time ranges such as the last 5 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, and 3 days. The monitoring panel displays the following information:

- QPS: The time-series diagram of the QPS.
- Query latency(P95): The time-series diagram of the query latency.
- CPU usage: The CPU usage of the cluster.
- Memory Utilization: The memory utilization of the cluster.
- Opened sessions: The total number of sessions created in the cluster.
- Slow Query: The number of slow queries in the cluster.

Users can click ![watch](https://docs-cdn.nebula-graph.com.cn/figures/watch.png) to jump to the detailed service monitoring panel page.

## Cluster topology

Shows the distribution and status of nodes and services in the cluster. Click **Cluster Topology** at the top of the page to enter the Cluster Topology page.

## Monitoring screen

The monitoring screen helps users understand the health status of the cluster and the information on services and nodes at a glance.

Click **Switch to Monitoring Screen** to enter the monitoring screen page.

| Screen area         | Information displayed                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Upper middle area | 1. The health degree of your cluster. The system scores the health of your cluster. For more information, see the following note. <br>2. The information and number of running nodes, the number of running services and abnormal services in the cluster. <br/>3. CPU and memory usage of the node at the current time.<br/>4. Alert notifications. The system displays the 5 most recently triggered alert messages based on their severity level (emergency>critical>warning). For more information, [Monitoring alerts](../4.cluster-operator/9.notification.md). |
| Lower middle area | Monitoring information of 4 Graph service metrics at different periods. The 4 metrics are: <br/>1. num_active_sessions<br/>2. num_slow_queries<br/>3. num_active_queries<br/>4. num_query_errors |
| Left side of the area     | 1. QPS (Query Per Second) of your cluster.<br/>2. The monitoring information of 2 Storage service metrics at different periods. The two metrics are: add_edges_latency_us,add_vertices_latency_us. |
| Right side of the area     | The node-related metrics information at different periods. Metrics include: <br/>1. cpu_utilization<br/>2. memory_utilization<br/>3. load_1m<br/>4. disk_readbytes<br/>5. disk_writebytes |

For more information about the monitoring metrics, see [Metrics](../7.monitor-parameter.md).

!!! note

    Cluster scoring rules are as follows:

    - The maximum score is 100; The minimum score is 13.
    - When 100≥Health Degree≥80, the score is blue; When 80＞Health Degree≥60, the score is yellow; When Health Degree＜60, the score is yellow.
    - Algorithm: (1-number of abnormal services/total number of services)*100%.
    - Except for the appearance of the first `emergency` level alert that deducts 40 points, 10 points are deducted for each of the other `emergency` level alerts and other levels of alerts.
