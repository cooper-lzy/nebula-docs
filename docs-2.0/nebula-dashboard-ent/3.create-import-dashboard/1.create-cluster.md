# Create clusters

This topic introduces how to create clusters using Dashboard.

## Steps

You can create a cluster following these steps:

1. At the top of the Dashboard page, click the **Cluster Management** button.
2. On the **Cluster management** page, click **Create cluster**.
3. On the **Create cluster** page, fill in the following:

  - Enter a **Cluster Name**, up to 15 characters for each name.
  - Choose a NebulaGraph version to install.

    !!! note

        Only one Enterprise Edition of NebulaGraph is provided for you to choose from on the **Create cluster** page. To install other versions of NebulaGraph, you can download or upload the corresponding installer package on the **Package Management** page. For details, see [Package management](../system-settings/manage-package.md).

    !!! note

        When creating a cluster with versions below 3.5.0, you need to upload the license certificate manually.

  - **Add nodes**. Enter the following information, the Host, SSH port, SSH user, authentication type, NebulaGraph package, etc.

    The authentication type is described as follows:

    - SSH Password: Enter the password of the SSH user.

    - SSH Key: Click **Upload** and select the private key file of the node. You need to generate the secret key files on the node to be added and send the private key file to the current computer (not the machine where Dashboard is deployed). If the passphrase is set, this parameter is also required.

    If you select **Use Sudo**, the user and user group of the installation directory and service process are set to `root`. If you do not select **Use Sudo**, the user and user group of the installation directory and service process are set to the customized user and user group.

  - **Import nodes in batches**. The information of each node is required. To import nodes in batches, you need to choose the installation package and click **download the CSV template**. Fill in the template and upload it. Ensure that the node is correct, otherwise, upload failure may happen.

4. Select the node and add the service you need in the upper right corner. To create a cluster, you need to add 3 types of services to the node. If not familiar with the NebulaGraph architecture, click **Auto add service**.

5. (Optional) Edit the port and HTTP port of the meta, graph, and storage services, and then click **OK**.

6. Click **Create Cluster**. Make sure the configuration is correct and there is no conflict between nodes, and then click **Confirm**.


7. If a cluster with the status of `installing` appears in the list on the cluster management page, you need to wait for 3 to 10 minutes until the status changes to `healthy`, that is, the cluster is created successfully. If the service status is `unhealthy`, it means that there is an abnormal service in the cluster, click **Detail** for more information.

## Next to do

After the cluster is successfully created, you can operate on the cluster. For details, see [Cluster operations](../4.cluster-operator/operator/node.md).
