        When logging into the NebulaGraph Dashboard Enterprise Edition for the first time, the content of *END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT* is displayed on the login page. Please read it and then click **I Agree**. 

2. Log into Dashboard with the default account name `nebula` and password `nebula`.

  !!! note

        You can create LDAP, OAuth2.0, or general accounts after logging into Dashboard. For more information about the Dashboard account, see [Authority Management](5.account-management.md).

3. Set the License to activate Dashboard. For details, see **Activate Dashboard** below.

## Activate Dashboard

Before using Dashboard, you must configure License Manager (LM) to validate the effectiveness of the license and activate Dashboard.

Users can configure LM in two ways to use Dashboard.

### Configure LM directly through Dashboard

The dashboard supports quick deployment of LM via a GUI. After logging into Dashboard, follow the steps below to complete the deployment of LM and start using Dashboard.

1. Click **Start** on the LM Introduction page.

2. Fill in the configuration information of the machine where LM is deployed, including host IP, SSH-related information, installation path, License Manager port, etc. After filling in the information, click **Install LM** to install it.

  !!! note

        It is recommended to use systemd to manage the LM process. In this case, the user and user group of the installation directory and service process must be `root`. The LM service is added to systemd automatically and configured to start automatically.

3. Fill in the License Key and click **Confirm**.

  !!! note

        After successfully installing the LM, an LMID is generated. You can copy the LMID and [bind the LMID to generate a license key on LC](../9.about-license/2.license-management-suite/2.license-center.md#bind_lmid_to_generate_a_license-key).
