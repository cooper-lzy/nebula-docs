# Deploy NebulaGraph with NebulaGraph Lite

Using [NebulaGraph Lite](https://github.com/nebula-contrib/nebulagraph-lite) can quickly deploy NebulaGraph and start experiencing NebulaGraph in just five minutes. It is ideal for ad-hoc development and learning NebulaGraph.

## Benefits

- Quick installation of NebulaGraph Lite through the Python package management tool.
- NebulaGraph Lite supports the deployment of NebulaGraph with non-root permission.
- NebulaGraph Lite supports the deployment of NebulaGraph in containers or any Jupyter Notebook platform on Linux-based systems.

## Steps

1. Run the following statement to install NebulaGraph Lite.

  ```bash
  pip3 install nebulagraph-lite
  ```

2. Start NebulaGraph Lite. NebulaGraph Lite automatically deploys and starts a single-node NebulaGraph service, and imports a test dataset.

  - Start from Jupyter Notebook

    ```bash
    from nebulagraph_lite import nebulagraph_let as ng_let
    n = ng_let()
    n.start()
    ```

  - Start from the command line

    ```bash
    nebulagraph start
    ```

The following result is returned indicating that the startup and import of the test dataset was successful.

```bash

                                                lite version

[ OK ] nebulagraph_lite started successfully!
```

## What's next
