# Keywords

Keywords in nGQL are words with particular meanings, such as `CREATE` and `TAG` in the `CREATE TAG` statement. Keywords that require special processing to be used as identifiers are referred to as `reserved keywords`, while the part of keywords that can be used directly as identifiers are called `non-reserved keywords`.

It is not recommended to use keywords to identify schemas. If you must use keywords as identifiers, pay attention to the following restrictions:

- To use reserved keywords or special characters as identifiers, you must enclose them with backticks (\`), such as \`AND\`. Otherwise, a syntax error is thrown.

- To use non-reserved keywords as identifiers:

  - If the identifier contains any uppercase letter, you must enclose them with backticks (\`), such as \`Comment\`. Otherwise, the execution succeeds but the system automatically converts the identifier to all lowercase.
  - If the identifier contains all lowercase letters, you do not need to enclose them with backticks (\`).

!!! note

    Keywords are case-insensitive.
