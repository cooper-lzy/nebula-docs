# Backup and restore data with snapshots

NebulaGraph supports using snapshots to back up and restore data. When data loss or misoperation occurs, the data will be restored through the snapshot.

## Prerequisites

NebulaGraph [authentication](../7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication.md) is disabled by default. In this case, all users can use the snapshot feature.

If authentication is enabled, only the GOD role user can use the snapshot feature. For more information about roles, see [Roles and privileges](../7.data-security/1.authentication/3.role-list.md).

## Precautions

* To prevent data loss, create a snapshot as soon as the system structure changes, for example, after operations such as `ADD HOST`, `DROP HOST`, `CREATE SPACE`, `DROP SPACE`, and `BALANCE` are performed.

* NebulaGraph cannot automatically delete the invalid files created by a failed snapshot task. You have to manually delete them by using [`DROP SNAPSHOT`](#delete_snapshots).

* Customizing the storage path for snapshots is not supported for now.

## Create snapshots

Run `CREATE SNAPSHOT` to create a snapshot for all the graph spaces based on the current time for NebulaGraph. Creating a snapshot for a specific graph space is not supported yet.

!!! note

    If the creation fails, refer to the later section to delete the corrupted snapshot and then recreate the snapshot.

```ngql
nebula> CREATE SNAPSHOT;
```

## View snapshots

To view all existing snapshots, run `SHOW SNAPSHOTS`.

```ngql
nebula> SHOW SNAPSHOTS;
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| Name                           | Status  | Hosts            |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| "SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12" | "VALID" | "127.0.0.1:9779" |
| "SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52" | "VALID" | "127.0.0.1:9779" |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
```

The parameters in the return information are described as follows.

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Name`    | The name of the snapshot directory. The prefix `SNAPSHOT` indicates that the file is a snapshot file, and the suffix indicates the time the snapshot was created (UTC). |
| `Status`  | The status of the snapshot. `VALID` indicates that the creation succeeded, while `INVALID` indicates that it failed.                                                    |
| `Hosts`   | The IPs (or hostnames) and ports of all Storage servers at the time the snapshot was created.                                                                                     |

### Snapshot path

Snapshots are stored in the path specified by the `data_path` parameter in the Meta and Storage configuration files. When a snapshot is created, the `checkpoints` directory is checked in the datastore path of the leader Meta service and all Storage services for the existence, and if it is not there, it is automatically created. The newly created snapshot is stored as a subdirectory within the `checkpoints` directory. For example, `SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12`. The suffix `2021_03_09_08_43_12` is generated automatically based on the creation time (UTC).

To fast locate the path where the snapshots are stored, you can use the Linux command `find` in the datastore path. For example:

```bash
$ cd /usr/local/nebula-graph-ent-{{nebula.release}}/data
$ find |grep 'SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12'
./data/meta2/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12
./data/meta2/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12/data
./data/meta2/nebula/0/checkpoints/SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12/data/000081.sst
...
```

## Delete snapshots

To delete a snapshot with the given name, run `DROP SNAPSHOT`.

```ngql
DROP SNAPSHOT <snapshot_name>;
```

Example:

```ngql
nebula> DROP SNAPSHOT SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_08_43_12;
nebula> SHOW SNAPSHOTS;
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| Name                           | Status  | Hosts            |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
| "SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52" | "VALID" | "127.0.0.1:9779" |
+--------------------------------+---------+------------------+
```

!!! note

    Deleting the only snapshot within the `checkpoints` directory also deletes the `checkpoints` directory. 

## Restore data with snapshots

!!! warning

    When you restore data with snapshots, make sure that the graph spaces backed up in the snapshot have not been dropped. Otherwise, the data of the graph spaces cannot be restored.

Currently, there is no command to restore data with snapshots. You need to manually copy the snapshot file to the corresponding folder, or you can make it by using a shell script. The logic implements as follows:

1. After the snapshot is created, the `checkpoints` directory is generated in the installation directory of the leader Meta service and all Storage services, and saves the created snapshot. Taking this topic as an example, when there are two graph spaces, the snapshots created are saved in `/usr/local/nebula/data/meta/nebula/0/checkpoints`, `/usr/local/nebula/data/storage/ nebula/3/checkpoints` and `/usr/local/nebula/data/storage/nebula/4/checkpoints`.

  ```bash
  $ ls /usr/local/nebula/data/meta/nebula/0/checkpoints/
  SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52
  $ ls /usr/local/nebula/data/storage/nebula/3/checkpoints/
  SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52
  $ ls /usr/local/nebula/data/storage/nebula/4/checkpoints/
  SNAPSHOT_2021_03_09_09_10_52
  ```

2. To restore the lost data through snapshots, you can take a snapshot at an appropriate time, copy the folders `data` and `wal` in the corresponding snapshot directory to its parent directory (at the same level with `checkpoints`) to overwrite the previous `data` and `wal`, and then restart the cluster.

  !!! warning

        The data and wal directories of all Meta services should be overwritten at the same time. Otherwise, the new leader Meta service will use the latest Meta data after a cluster is restarted.
